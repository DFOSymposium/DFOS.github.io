Public website for the Derivative-Free Optimization Symposium (DFOS)

DFOS is a community-driven, single-track symposium highlighting the latest international developments in Derivative-free Optimization (DFO) and occuring biennially. The main goal is to find new connections between research focused in DFO algorithmic design and novel applications of DFO. A single-track workshop facilitates the interaction among participants, strengthening possibilities of collaboration.
